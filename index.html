        <h2>About</h2>
        <p id="description">This is a university project that uses a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.
        Try it out by drawing a digit (0 to 9) in the box above and see if the network can guess which one you drew!
         
        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>I built the network using javascript, and it's hosted on a NodeJS server. It was trained using the MNIST
        data set, which is a collection of 70,000 images. When you draw an image above and click submit, the image is converted
        into a format that the neural network can understand. First, it is downscaled to 28x28 pixels, and is then converted to
        black and white (grayscale). The image below shows what the network is seeing when you submit a drawing. The
        converted image is then sent through the network and a 'guess' is returned. This guess is contains which digit
        the network thinks the image is, and how confident it is with its guess.</p>
